1. Write a program 
    * Define a structure to represent Box
    * Develop functions to find volume, total surface area of a Box.
    * Use effective parameter passing and appropriate return value

   and single integer represeting total no.of seconds, 1:2:30 means 3750 seconds
   One function takes time structure variables and return total no.of seconds
   Another function takes total no.of seconds and empty structure variable, and update the   
   struct variable. You may also add a function to initialize structure with the help of    
   string in "hh:mm:ss" format 

4. Implement a student/employee structure, with struct hack/FAM concept for name field.
   * Create the structure
   * Display the structure variables
   * Copy structures
