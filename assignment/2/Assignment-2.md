1. Implement follwing string operations on your own, prefer pointer approach than []
   * string length - mystrlen
   * string copy - mystrcpy
   * string concatenation - mystrcat
   * string compare - mystrcmp
Develop modular function for each computation and suitable file hierarchy, use suitable parameters and return types (same prototype of std functions). i.e instead of printing results in functions, return the results and print them in test code (main function)

2. Implement follwing string operations on your own, prefer pointer based traversal than []
   * string reverse
   * toggle the case of each char in string
   * convert string as integer
   * given chracter found or not (return the index if found)
   * substring with start position and no.of character
   * sustring found or not in main string

Develop modular function for each computation and suitable file hierarchy, use suitable parameters and return types. i.e instead of printing results in functions, return the results
and print them in test code (main function)
   
3. Implement a simple calculator as follows
An expression will be given in string format, e.g. "2+3", "4*5", "9-2", "6&2", "
Develop modular function for each computation and suitable file hierarchy
You may start with assumption that each operand is of single digit, but scale it up
to support operands of multiple digits.Also start with single letter operators +, -, *, /, &, |, ^ etc and then scale up to multi lettered operators, &&, ||, >> etc

4. Write a program to perform following operations on command line arguments, assuming all  
   arguments are in numeric form (integers)
   * sum & avg
   * min/max 

5. Write a program to convert enum of colors with their hex codes in string form and vice   
   versa, For e.g. red maps to 0xFF0000, blue maps to 0x0000FF, white maps to 0xFFFFFF

6. Implement following operations on table of strings (2D character array)
    * Linear search
    * Any sorting technique
    * Find the string with max length 
    * Count all strings, whose length is greater than certain limit.
Develop modular function for each computation and suitable file hierarchy

7. Develop following string functions.
    * Given string is isogram or not
    * left rotate given string by k positions
    * right rotate given string by k positions
Write the main function with suitable test plan for above.

8. Write the functions for following conversions on string representing mutiple words
    * snake case to camel case
    * pascal case to snake case
